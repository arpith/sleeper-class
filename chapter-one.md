I feel terrible. The train just started. My body aches in places that haven't been used. The coach jolts as we move faster. "Sit another way," my back says to me. The corner looks uninviting but the pain is insistent. The dirt is black, but inconsistent, wiped half-heartedly by the shirts of passengers on journeys past. I rest my head on the wall and try not to think about the oil from the hair of those successful travellers. I suppose it's too late now. 

A head appears through the window on the opposite side of the coach. Wet with sweat, bobbing up and down with effort, he strains to lift something. I'm amazed he's managed to keep up with us at all. It's a box. "Open the window," he yells. The man inside dutifully does so. It's an emergency window, so the grills slide all the way up into the wall. "Pass it, quick," he yells outside. The box is in and the head disappears. The platform outside is now a blur of coffee machines and people standing. What does one do after seeing someone off at a train? The train is too fast for a prolonged goodbye, it's much faster than a bus where you can wave and wave until your hand tires and you have exhausted yourself with your shouts of well wishes. I suppose. The train is still there though, you could reach out and touch it and lose an arm if you wished, it's just that the people you have come to see off are now further and further away from you. 

A man stops beside me. I crane my neck to see what he wants, and I'm surprised. It's the head from outside the window, now attached a heaving body, catching a breath before moving any further. I hadn't thought he would make it, this portly man with a combover waving high over his head. With every deep breath his shirt pulled at its buttons. "I didn't think so, either," he nods at me, before smiling at the man who had grabbed his bag for him. "I'm Eleazer."

"No problem," says the man at the window, "come, sit down." Eleazer begins talking, fast, taking small breaths in between before lurching forward again.
